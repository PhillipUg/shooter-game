<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This is a 2D shooting game. It is only browser-based and built with Phaser 3 game engine. The player's job is to try to avoid a spider infestation. So the player should keep shooting them as they appear from all angles. The main objective of the game is to keep the number of spiders on your back porche below 5. If more than 5 spiders appear, they overwhelm and defeat you.

For each spider you shoot, 50 points will be added to your score. In the end, you will be added to the leaderboard if you come out among the best.

## How to play
When the game first starts;
* A dialogue box shows up requesting you to enter your name.
* After you enter your name and click `submit`, it takes you to another screen with two buttons, `play` and `credits`.
* Click `play` to start the game.
* To play, all you need to do is point with your cursor and `right-click` to shoot.
* Everytime you `hover` the game screen, the player changes direction following where you move the cursor pointer.
